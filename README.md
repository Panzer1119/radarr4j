## Requirements

Building the API client library requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to be installed.

## Installation & Usage

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn deploy
```

Refer to the [official documentation](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/usage.html) for more information.

After the client library is installed/deployed, you can use it in your Maven project by adding the following to your *pom.xml*:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.codemakers</groupId>
    <artifactId>radarr4j</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.0</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

Or to your *build.gradle*:

```groovy
implementation group: "de.codemakers", name: "radarr4j", version: "3.1.0"
```

## Developer Guide

Make sure you have set up your local Git Hooks:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This will make sure your commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Here's some handy commands:

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `gradle test` | Run the tests. |
| `gradle build` | Run the builds. |
| `gradle shadowJar` | Create the Uber Jar with all Dependencies. |

## Semantic Versioning

This project uses `standard-release` to update the version in the `build.gradle` file from the changes in the history and to create the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

Any time you want to cut a new release, run:

```sh
npx dwmkerr/standard-version --sign
```

This will:

- Update the `CHANGELOG.md`
- Update the version number based on the commit history
- Create a git tag with the new version number

Finally, just push the tag to trigger a deployment of the new version:

```sh
git push --follow-tags
```
